* Password Generator

* In this assignment we were tasked with creating a random password generator.

* When the user loads the page they are prompted with a series of confirms about the criteria of the password.
Specifically if they would like to include numbers, special characters and capital letters.

* After that I created a function to combine to possible characters with the results from the confirms to get a password the user has narrowed down.

Technology Used: Javascript, HTML, CSS
